<h3>Create the following Program</h3>
a2 + b2 = c2
Create a program that asks the user if they have a right triangle. You will be given 2 sides of the triangle. You must write a program that finds the length of the missing side. You must write a program the finds the perimeter, and area of the triangle.

The program must not end until you type the word STOP or Exit.

<b>Example:</b> Right triangle A side = 5, B side = 6, C side = ??
Output: C side = 7.81
